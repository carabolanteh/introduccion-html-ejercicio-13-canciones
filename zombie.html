    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Another head hangs lowly
        Child is slowly taken
        And the violence, caused such silence
        Who are we mistaken?
        But you see, it's not me
        It's not my family
        In your head, in your head, they are fighting
        With their tanks, and their bombs
        And their bombs, and their guns
        In your head, in your head they are crying
        In your head, in your head
        Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
        What's in your head, in your head
        Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
        Du, du, du, du
        Du, du, du, du
        Du, du, du, du
        Du, du, du, du
        Another mother's breaking
        Heart is taking over
        When the violence causes silence
        We must be mistaken
        It's the same old theme
        Since nineteen-sixteen
        In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
        With their tanks, and their bombs
        And their bombs, and their guns
        In your head, in your head, they are dying
        In your head, in your head
        Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
        What's in your head, in your head
        Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
        Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, ay, oh, ya ya</p>
